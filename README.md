## Fraction calculator.

This was originally part of a library written for a Dotnet project for a scale modelling project to aide with converting Imperial to Metric measurements.

I decided to rewrite it in Fortran as an exercise to see if I can do it, but also to learn about types.

The Makefile has been updated to compile a library for use with other Fortran programs.
